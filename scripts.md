## Level 1

Hello, hello hello? So look, I know this job posting is--pretty weird and all. 
I mean, yar stuck in this abandon building, working the night shift.
And this random dude from Craigslist is paying ya an obscene amount of money to 
do so (I mean really, I'm probably paying ya too much). But hey, that's why I 
left this message for ya, so ya know what to expect around here. So this old 
dump has got some problems with the ceiling, these tiles, they keep falling out man.
And that's why you're here. Whenever a tile falls out, all you gotta do is click
on the gap to repair it. Got that? It's a simple job really.  

Now, the thing is I don't really know what's up in that ceiling, and quite 
frankly I don't want to know. No matter what you see up there, you gotta just 
keep patching it up, just don't let the building fall apart for the night and 
someone will take care of it in the morning. 

Alright, thanks man, take care.

## Level 2

Uh, hey there, it's me again. How did last night go for ya, anything up there I 
should know about? Well, even if you did see anything, not like you can tell me
now, since this is a recording, haha. Anyway, sometimes wild animals wonder into
this building, but don't worry, it's not like they have rabies or anything, alright?
It's just, for some reason they all seem to be attracted to the ceiling, like there's
a treat up there or something. Just be careful not to let them tamper with it, ok?
