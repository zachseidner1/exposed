## Level 1

Hello, hello hello? So look, I know this job posting is--pretty weird and all. 
I mean, yar stuck in this abandon building, working the night shift.
And this random dude from Craigslist is paying ya an obscene amount of money to 
do so (I mean really, I'm probably paying ya too much). But hey, that's why I 
left this message for ya, so ya know what to expect around here. So this old 
dump has got some problems with the ceiling, these tiles keep falling out man.
And that's why you're here. Whenever a tile falls out, all you gotta do is click
on the gap to repair it. Got that? It's a simple job really.  

Now, the thing is I don't really know what's up in that ceiling, and quite 
frankly I don't want to know. No matter what you see up there, you gotta just 
keep patching it up, just don't let the building fall apart for the night and 
someone will take care of it in the morning. 

Alright, thanks man,
