# Exposed Design Document

## Concept statement
You are hired to do maintenance on an abandon building at night. The ceiling tiles keep falling out and you need to keep fixing them before they fall out of the ceiling. Can you keep the ceiling whole, even with when what comes out of it might haunt you?

## Gameplay loop
Whack-a-mole but with ceiling tiles. On later nights, some ceiling tiles will not be repairable and enemies will come out of the ceiling. You have to manage these enemies as well as the ceiling falling down. 

## Enemy types
### Raccoon
The Raccoon will slowly approach the trashcan in phases. It's last phase will be the shortest, so the player will have to pay closer attention to the Raccoon when it is in its second to last phase. If the raccoon jumps into the trashcan, the trashcan will fall over, hitting a light switch on the way down, making it impossible to see the ceiling tiles or do your job.

### Snake

### Goose

### Something else
